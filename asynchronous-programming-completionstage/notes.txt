Asynchronous and concurrent are two different notions.
We can be asynchronous without being concurrent, and being concurrent does not necessarily mean that we are asynchronous.
A task can be asynchronous and still be called in the thread we are running in.
Also we can be Asynchronous yet blocking like Runnable.

future.get() is a blocking call

we need the following:
being able to trigger taskB upon completion of taskA
being able to specify in which thread a task is executed
