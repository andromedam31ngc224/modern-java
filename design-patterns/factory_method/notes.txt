it is the opposite of singleton pattern.
it does not expose instantiation logic.
the client has no knowledge of the object being created. not even its type.
the client just knows the interface that the factory exposes.
java examples: ResourceBundle; Calendar; NumberFormat
in singleton you get just one single instance of the implemented class whereas in factory method you can have multiple instances
e.g. Calendar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factory is responsible for life cycle management
typically a method to request an object is parameterized
